# Telco Customer Churn SQL Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications company using SQL. The objective is to identify key factors that influence customer churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention. The analysis is performed using SQL queries within a Jupyter Notebook environment to extract and analyze data efficiently.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about telecom customers including:
- Customer demographics: gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents
- Account details: tenure, contract type, payment method
- Services subscribed: phone, internet, streaming, security, backup
- Financial metrics: monthly charges, total charges
- Target variable: churn (Yes or No)

## Objectives
1. Understand churn distribution across different customer groups.
2. Identify which contract types and payment methods have the highest churn.
3. Examine the relationship between tenure, charges, and churn rate.
4. Evaluate the impact of internet service type on customer churn.
5. Generate actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

## Insights and Findings
- Month-to-month contract customers show the highest churn rate.  
- Customers with electronic check payments churn more frequently.  
- Longer-tenured customers are less likely to leave the service.  
- Fiber optic internet users have a higher churn rate than DSL users.  
- High monthly charges often correlate with early churn.  

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL (MySQL / PL-SQL)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Data Cleaning and Analysis  
- MS Excel Dataset: Telco Customer Churn  

## Conclusion
The analysis identifies key churn factors including contract type, payment method, and service category.  
Focusing on long-term contracts, customer engagement, and payment flexibility can significantly improve customer retention.  
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for business-driven data analysis and churn prediction insights.
